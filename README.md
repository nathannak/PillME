PillMe is another pill/medication scheduling app, but it carries a complete list of medications to choose from, and also it simplifies medication scheduling by letting users choose relevant symbols for their medications. PillMe can effectively breaks through the doze-mode, sleep-mode, and do-not-disturb-mode to remind users of their scheduled medications. PillMeâ€™s set alarms are restart/Force Stop proof, however to be able to effectively get notified, PillMe needs to be added to whitelist on certain phones like Huawei P8 so it can send notifications and make some noise while phone is sleeping. PillMe is Time Zone change proof and preserves your med taking plan; alarms/notification timings remain the same as you travel around the world. Of course you can modify, save, restart, and reload your plan in new Time Zones.
